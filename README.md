# C-Console-App---PFX-to-CRT-and-KEY-Converter
This project is a simple C# console application that converts a PFX (Personal Information Exchange) file into separate CRT (Certificate) and KEY (Private Key) files. This is particularly useful when you need to extract these files to be used in web servers or other applications.
